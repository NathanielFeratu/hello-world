# hello-world
Playing in my Sandbox,

Greetings Everyone!
I've started using and experimenting with GNOME Boxes so if you have a program you'd like to have tested in another OS environnment, let me know. I have multiple versions of iOS, Windows, and Linux distros that I can run them through and provide feedback for you. I am busy with a new business that I just started and I'm still developing and building the foundations for. I'm a full time college student studying Industrial Electronics/ Robotics; but, what spare time I do have I like to help others however I can. Cheers!  

Contact me and let me know which specific Os('s) you'd like it run through and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!
