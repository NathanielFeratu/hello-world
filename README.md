Playing in my Sandbox
Greetings Everyone!
I've started using and experimenting with GNOME Boxes so if you have a program you'd like to have tested in another OS enviropnment, let me know. I have multiple versions of iOS, Windows, and Linux distros that I can run them through and provide feedback for you. I am busy with a new business that I just started and full time college classes in Industrial Electronics/ Robotics; but, what spare time I do have I like to help others however I can. Cheers!
